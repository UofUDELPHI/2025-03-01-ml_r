    "text": "General Information\nWhat: This workshop provides a practical introduction to foundational machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost, with hands-on applications and best practices using tidymodels in R. Note that this workshop will NOT cover Large Language Models (LLMs) and while it may touch on Neural Network (NN)/Deep Learning models briefly at the end of the workshop, these will not be the focus.\nWho: This workshop is designed for researchers, staff, and students who want to gain experience using machine learning techniques in practice in the R programming language.\nPrerequisites: Participants should be familiar with the basics of the R programming language, including the tidyverse. Participants do not need to have any previous machine learning, statistical or mathematical experience to attend this workshop.\nRequirements: Participants must bring a laptop onto which they can download R and Rstudio (and you should do so before the workshop).\nContact: Please email andrew.george@hsc.utah.edu and rebecca.barter@hsc.utah.edu for more information."
