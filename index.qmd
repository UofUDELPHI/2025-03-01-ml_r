## General Information

**What**: This workshop provides a practical introduction to foundational machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forest, and XGBoost, with hands-on applications and best practices using tidymodels in R. Note that this workshop will NOT cover Large Language Models (LLMs) and while it may touch on Neural Network (NN)/Deep Learning models briefly at the end of the workshop, these will not be the focus.

**Who**: This workshop is designed for researchers, staff, and students who want to gain experience using machine learning techniques in practice in the R programming language. 

**Prerequisites**: Participants should be familiar with the basics of the R programming language, including the tidyverse. Participants do *not* need to have any previous machine learning, statistical or mathematical experience to attend this workshop.

**Requirements**: Participants must bring a laptop onto which they can [download R and Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (and you should do so before the workshop).

**Contact**: Please email andrew.george@hsc.utah.edu and rebecca.barter@hsc.utah.edu for more information.



## Resources


### Posit Cloud

A Posit Cloud workspace will be set up prior to the workshop for those who cannot (or prefer not to) install applications on their laptop.


### Download files and data

All relevant files will be provided here prior to the workshop.

<!-- If you are working in RStudio locally (rather than using posit cloud, above) [click here](content.zip "download")XXXXXXX to download all of the .qmd files and data files we will be using throughout the workshop. -->


## Schedule

Note that the schedule below serves as a guideline. The start, end, and break times are fixed, but timing for each topics covered may vary as we may go faster or slower through the content.

**Note that morning snacks and lunch will be provided on both days**.
